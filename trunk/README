How to use makefile
******************************

1) make clean

2) make all coll=gather

Valid options for coll: gather, allGather, allReduce, barrier, broadcast

3) make run coll=gather


*******************************
Control variables in Make file:
*******************************

paradigm=mpi
//Use to indicate which paradigm is benchmarked and make appropriate changes
//in code using preprocessor.
//Right now only mpi collectives are benchmarked. Others (UPC, Co-array)  will be added later.

delayRank= //delayRank tells about rank which needs to delayed.
delay=     //tells about much a particular rank should be delayed.

//This benchmark can be used to test collective around range of process.
//This range can be selected using below mentioned variables.
//Number of process using collectives will increment from startNo to endNo, by the power of 2.
startNo=
endNo=

//Data size used by collectives can be varied in this benchmark.
//Data size range can be specified by below mentioned variables.
//Values between lower and upper limits is incremented by the power of 2.
dataStart=
dateEnd=
